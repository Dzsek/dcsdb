# Description

This project is meant to be a database containing information on all usable modules and weapons in DCS.

## Features

* Search for modules and weapons by name
* Weapons available for each module referenced under said module

The idea came from the attempt of /u/LtCol_Davenport to create pdf documents describing the available weapons.
