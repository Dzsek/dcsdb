  "description": "The Boeing AH-64 Apache is an American twin-turboshaft attack helicopter with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement and a tandem cockpit for a crew of two. \r\nIt features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. \r\nIt is armed with a 30 mm (1.18 in) M230 chain gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. \r\nThe AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\r\n\r\nThe D version is equipped with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system \r\nand the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor.",
