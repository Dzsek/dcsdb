  "description": "The AGM-122 Sidearm was an American air-to-surface anti-radiation missile produced between 1986 and 1990. While not as capable as newer anti-radiation missiles, they were cheaper and lighter in weight allowing more versatile deployment.\r\n\r\nIt was produced by the re-manufacture of AIM-9C missiles that had been taken out of service, which were a semi-active radar homing variant of the Sidewinder.",
