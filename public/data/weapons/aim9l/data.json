  "description": "The AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile which entered service with the US Navy in 1956 and subsequently was adopted by the US Air Force in 1964. \r\n\r\nSince then the Sidewinder has proved to be an enduring international success, and its latest variants are still standard equipment in most western-aligned air forces.\r\n\r\nThe Lima version was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on, which had a dramatic effect on close-in combat tactics.
