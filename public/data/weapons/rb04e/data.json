  "description": "The RB-04 (Robot 04) is a long-range fire-and-forget air-to-surface, anti-ship missile.\r\n\r\nThe E version had a shorter wingspan and improved guidance system and new monopulse radar seeker, which allowed sea-skimming approaches. \r\n\r\nThis version was highly resistant to ECM and would automatically lock on especially powerful jamming signals.",
