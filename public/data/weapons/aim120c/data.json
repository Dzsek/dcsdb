  "description": "The AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM (pronounced AM-ram), is an American beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile capable of all-weather day-and-night operations. \r\n\r\nDesigned with a 7-inch (180mm) diameter form-and-fit factor, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it has the advantage of being a fire-and-forget weapon when compared to the previous generation Sparrow missiles.\r\n\r\nThe AIM-120C has smaller \"clipped\" aerosurfaces, and an improved fuse compared to its predecessor",
