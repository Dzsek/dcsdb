  "description": "The AGM-65 Maverick is an air-to-ground missile designed for close air support. \r\n\r\nIt is the most widely produced precision-guided missile in the Western world, and is effective against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.\r\n\r\nThe D version replaced the electro-optical guidance with an imaging infrared system which doubled the practical firing distance and allowed for its use at night and during bad weather. A reduced smoke rocket engine was also introduced in this model.",
