Instructions for editing the database

Introduction:
The application is implemented as a static website, meaning no backend. 
This is why the so called "database" consists of a series of folders and json files that the website fetches using simple get requests to the right urls.

File structure:
-data                   #folder containing all the data available to the website
--aircrafts             #folder containing all the aircraft data
---aircrafts.json       #file containing a list of all available aircraft
---[aircraftid]         #folder containg data about an aircraft, there should be one for each aircraft defined in the aircrafts.json file. It is put in brackets to signify that the name depends on the aircraft
----data.json           #file containg data about the aircraft
----thumbnail.jpg       #image used for the aircraft in the application
--weapons               #folder containing all the weapon data
---weapons.json         #file containing a list of all available weapons
---[weaponid]           #folder containg data about a weapon, there should be one for each weapon defined in the weapons.json file. It is put into brackets to signify that the name depends on the weapon.
----data.json           #file containg data about the weapon
----thumbnail.jpg       #image used for the weapon in the application

Format of the files (will be using F/A-18C and AIM-9X as examples):

---aircrafts.json---

This file consists of a json array with each object having the following format
{
    "id":"fa18c",
    "name":"F/A-18C",
    "tags": ["hornet","navy","carrier"]
}

id - unique, only contains lower case letters and numbers, use a simplified name of the aircraft
name - name to be displayed on the aircraft cards when viewing lists of aircraft, also used when searching for aircraft using the search bar
tags - additional strings to search for when searching using the search bar, use this for alternate spellings and nicknames to make it easier for users to find what they're looking for

---[fa18c]---

The name of this folder should be exactly the same as the id field defined in aircrafts.json

---data.json (aircraft)---

The file contains a single json object

{
    "name":"McDonnel Douglass F/A-18C Hornet",
    "description": "general information about the hornet",
    "weapons": {
        "aam": [
            { "id":"aim9x", "name":"AIM-9X" },
            { "id":"aim7m", "name":"AIM-7M" },
            { "id": "aim120b", "name":"AIM-120B"}
        ],
        "agm": [],
        "bomb": [],
        "fuel": [],
        "pod": [],
        "rocket": []
    }
}

name - Full name for the aircraft used only when viewing the aircraft page
description - general information about the aircraft
weapons - json object with each property representing a category of weapons similar to how they are categorized in the DCS loadout editor
          each property is a json array containg objects with two properties, "id" is the id of the weapon, "name" is the name to be displayed on the weapon card in the aircraft view
 aam - air to air weapons
 agm - air to ground weapons
 bomb - bombs
 fuel - fuel pods
 pod - targeting pods, gunpods, etc.
 rocket - rockets

---weapons.json---

This file consists of a json array with each object having the following format
{
    "id":"aim9x",
    "name":"AIM-9X",
    "tags": ["sidewinder", "ir", "fox2", "heatseaker", "aa", "missile"]
}

id - unique, only contains lower case letters and numbers, use a simplified name of the weapon
name - name to be displayed on the weapon cards when viewing lists of weapons, also used when searching for weapons using the search bar
tags - additional strings to search for when searching using the search bar, use this for alternate spellings and nicknames 
       to make it easier for users to find what they're looking for

---[aim9x]---

The name of this folder should be exactly the same as the id field defined in weapons.json

---data.json (weapon)---

The file contains a single json object

{
    "name": "AIM-9X Sidewinder",
    "description" : "sidey-windy",
    "data":{
        "Weight": "1kg",
        "Range": "far away",
        "Guidance": "Infared",
        "Type":"Short Range Air-to-Air Missile",
        "Warhead": "high explosive",
        "Targets": "Aircraft"
    },
    "aircraft" : [
        {
            "id": "fa18c", 
            "name":"F/A-18C",
            "instructions":[
                "Arm",
                "Aim",
                "Launch"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

name - Full name for the aircraft used only when viewing the weapon page
description - general information about the weapon
data - json object describing various properties of the weapon, you can define any property you would like here, try to keep the property names to only letters and numbers
aircraft - array of json objects listing which aircrafts can use the weapon, "id" is the id of the aircraft, "name" is the name to show on the aircraft card
           "instructions" is an array of strings containing usage instructions for the weapon, each string should be it's own instruction. 
           can be formated by using \n for newlines and \t for tabs. Spaces will also be preserved

---image files---

storage on github pages is limited to 1GB per webstie, and bandwidth is limited to 100GB/month
most users wont care much about image quality as the focus is more on the data being presented and loading the pages as fast as possible

do not create images that are larger resolution then needed
use jpg format as the small file sizes offset the loss of quality from the compression

thumbnail.jpg
- used on cards
- minimum size width:250 heigth:160

image.jpg
- used on the weapon and aircraft pages for the main image
- minimum size width:610 height:390

if image.jpg is not found thumbnail.jpg will be loaded instead
